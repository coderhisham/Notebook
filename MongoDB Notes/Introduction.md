* MongoDB is a popular, open-source No-SQL database program.
* It's designed to store and manage structured, semi-structured, and unstructured data. 
* Unlike traditional relational databases, which store data in tables with rows and columns MongoDB stores data in flexible, JSON-like documents with dynamic schemas. This allows for more agile and scalable development, especially in applications where the data structure is subject to frequent change.
* MongoDB is known for its scalability, performance, and ease of use. It's widely used in modern web development, big data, real-time analytics, content management systems, and mobile applications. It supports various features such as ad hoc queries, indexing, replication, load balancing, and file storage. Additionally, MongoDB offers robust tools for data management, monitoring, and security.
* MongoDB uses [[BSON]] instead of JSON
* **==Document==** :  Mongo stores data in form of Documents (BSON Docs). Document refers to the rows in terms of SQL Databases
* **==Collections==** : MongoDB stores documents in Collections. Collection is the alternative for Tables in SQL Databases
